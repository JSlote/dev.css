dev.css
======

When you're templating and routing it's helpful to see html elements labeled and visible while still being able to interact with the webpage. Dev.css does exactly that. Add it to your html header like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://rawgit.com/JSlote/dev.css/master/dev.css">
```
