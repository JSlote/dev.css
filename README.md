dev.css
======

When you're templating and routing it's helpful to see html elements labeled and and visible even if they're empty while still being able to interact with the webpage. `Dev.css` does exactly that, as well as displays the current ids and classes assigned to each element. Add it to your `<head>` like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://rawgit.com/JSlote/dev.css/master/dev.css">
```
